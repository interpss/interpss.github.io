### Key Features
- **API-first and Rich API** - More than 10,000 APIs covering all models, solvers and result processing are publicly available for interation and customization
- **Light-weight yet powerful** - The core module is less than 4 Mb and the total size including dependent packages is less than 70MB (as of August 2025); it can solve large-scale power systems of ~ 100,000 buses
- **Cloud native and cross-platform (Win, Linux, Mac)** - Native Java design, highly portable across platforms, and easy for cloud deployment
- **AC/DC Load Flow Analysis** - Comprehensive power flow calculations for transmission (positive-sequence) and distribution (three-phase) systems 
- **Contingency Analysis** - N-1 and N-K outage studies
- **Sensitivity Analysis** - Various sensitivity calculations such as LODF and GSF for system analysis and trading applications
- **Short circuit analysis** - Three-sequence network modeling and comprehensive system fault analysis
- **Dynamic Stability Analysis** - Transient stability simulations for transmission and distribution systems invidividually or combined
